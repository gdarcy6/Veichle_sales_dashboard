# Vehicle Sales Dashboard

This dashboard was created using streamlit for the interface and plotly for interactive plots.

The dataset used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedanwarafridi/vehicle-sales-data

The dashboard shows car sales across the USA between January 2014 to July 2015. The dashboard can be filtered to show sales by car model year, car brand and by state sold in. The graphs update based on what the user selects. 
There are four charts displayed, the first shows car sale trends by brands over the time frame. The second shows the sales distribution by brand. The third shows the condition based price analysis and shows the spread based on the condition index of each car sold.
Lastly, there is a heat map of the USA which shows the distribution of car sales across the country.
